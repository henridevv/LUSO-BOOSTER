1 - Create Restore Point 

Run Create Restore Point, click create, put whatever name you want, and click create (done)!

^^^This is important because if you dont want the config and optimizations you can go back to your old settings! 

2 - Open Boost pack

3 - Open Cleanup folder > Run Temp Delete.cmd > Run Wupdatecache.cmd > Delete Log.cmd (as admin)

after running all that run Disk Clean-Up and select your disk to clean useless files! (if you have more than one disk do it in each one)

4 - Open Disable Services folder > Run all Registry files one by one (this are programs and services that are running in you computer without you not using them)(run as admin)

5 - Go Back to boost Pack and run Optimize Windows Settings.reg (as admin)

6 - Now run > "Turn Off Auto Windows Updates.cmd (as admin)

7 - last step is trun off startup apps that you dont use > run Startup Apps > right click on any app that you dont use daily and click disable (no need run this as admin)

Extra Info :

I know run as admin is creepy or whatever the proble is that for cmd to make changes on your pc need the permission of "run as admin" same as "reg"(registry ) files!
